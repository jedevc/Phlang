Phlang is made up of triggers and responses. The syntax is as follows:
        TRIGGERS \[TRIGGER_ARGS, ...\]
        RESPONSE \[RESPONSE_ARGS, ...\]

Note that triggers and responses can be in any case and that the number of
arguments differ for the command. You can have as many responses as you
like to a single trigger and as many triggers as your heart desires.

Back references also work similarly to Botbot. \1 is replaced by the first
match \2 is replaced by the second match, and so on. Phlang also has variables
which can be accessed using %VAR to get the value of VAR. The sender variable
contains the name of the message sender.

Botbot style expressions also work in the responses:
\{a, b, c\} - Choose randomly between the 3 options.
\[a, b, c\] - Send separate messages with the 3 options.
Like Botbot, these expressions can be embedded in each other.

Available triggers are:
MSG regex - Trigger on an incoming message matching the regex.
TIMER delay regex - Trigger after a delay in seconds on an message matching a
regex.
PTIMER - Same as timer, but when triggered again, resets the timer.
START - Triggers once when the bot starts.

Available responses are:
SEND message - Send a root level message.
REPLY message - Send a reply to the message that triggered it.
NICK nick - Set the bot's nick.
SET var value - Set the specified variable to the given value.
BREAKIF first second - Stop the flow of control if first is equal second.
